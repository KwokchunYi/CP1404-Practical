# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was initially inconsistent, often underestimating the time required.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved as I gained experience and learned to factor in potential challenges and complexities.
### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller steps and accounting for uncertainties to make more realistic estimates.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It allows me to review the code more carefully and improve my work through constructive feedback.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned to critically analyze code for quality, identify best practices, and enhance my own coding skills by observing different approaches.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[]()https://github.com/JiajunJiang-Oscar/CP1404practical/pull/9#discussion_r1855867941

### Explanation

The code structure is simple and clear. The Band class clearly manages the relationship between the band and the musicians
### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/K-lui/cp1404practicals/pull/7#discussion_r1855858669
[]()

### Explanation

The code structure is clear, the tests cover key functions, and the is_dynamic method logic is simple and practical.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would provide more real-world examples, incorporate collaborative coding tasks, and offer detailed feedback to enhance practical learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently broke down tasks effectively, wrote clean, functional code, and thoroughly tested my solutions to ensure reliability.
