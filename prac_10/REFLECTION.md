Throughout the course, the accuracy of my estimates for practical tasks varied. Initially, my ability to accurately estimate the time and effort required for tasks was not very precise. However, as I became more familiar with the types of tasks and my own working style, my estimates improved. I learned to account for potential setbacks and to better gauge the complexity of the tasks.

## Lessons from Code Reviews
Participating in code reviews has been incredibly enlightening. When my code was reviewed, I received valuable feedback that helped me improve my coding practices and consider perspectives I hadn't previously. Reviewing others' code taught me new techniques and approaches to problem-solving. It also forced me to think critically about what constitutes clean, maintainable code.

Collaborative coding can lead to deeper understanding and allows for immediate peer review and feedback. Additionally, I would introduce more real-world scenarios that require integrating different technologies, as this would prepare students for industry practices.
