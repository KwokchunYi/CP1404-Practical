"""
# Python has a number of random functions
#contained within the random module.
# Unlike the built-in functions (print(), input(), etc.)
# the random functions are not built-in but need to be imported.
# Modules are reusable collections of functions,
# classes and variables (constants) related to a specific topic
# (e.g., maths, operating system services, handling dates and times).
# Python has a useful built-in function for finding out about the local scope
#of something, called dir().

#print(random.randint(a: 5, b:20))  # line 1
#what did you see on line 1?
#15

#print(random.randint)(5, 20)
#what was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
#5,20 both included

#what idi you see on line 2?
#print(random.randrange(3, 10, 2))
#what was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
#Return number between 3 to 9
#Could line 2 have produced a 4?
#No

#what did you see on line 3?
#print(random.uniform(2.5, 5.5))
#what was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest
#2.5, 5.5

write code, not a comment, to produce a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive
